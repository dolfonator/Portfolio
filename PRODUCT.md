## Platform

web

## Users

Owners and decision-makers of Philippine local businesses — restaurants, cafés,
clinics, and small service teams, mostly in and around Quezon City. They are
non-technical, usually evaluating on a phone over metered mobile data, and
deciding one thing: *"Is this developer legit and worth emailing?"* Their job to
be done is to judge credibility fast, then reach out with the least friction.

A secondary audience is peers and recruiters spot-checking the craft — the build
quality of the portfolio itself is part of what they're judging.

## Product Purpose

A freelance web-developer portfolio that converts local-business owners into
inbound inquiries (email and phone). It exists to prove, by demonstration, that
Tristan ships fast, polished, practical websites — the site itself is the
strongest sample of the work. Success is a qualified inquiry landing in the
inbox; the credibility signal to peers is a supporting outcome. This is a v1 on a
free Netlify subdomain: static-first, no forms, one contact path.

## Brand Commitments

Bold and modern, but grounded and trustworthy — "this person is sharp, and I can
rely on them." Voice is plain-spoken and confident with zero jargon, quietly
proud of the craft. Three words: **confident, precise, warm**. Trust is carried
by the navy system; personality and warmth come from the amber accent, decisive
typography, and human copy. The emotional target is a non-technical owner feeling
reassured enough to hit "Email me."

Anti-references that remain binding:

- **Generic AI SaaS**: gradient blobs, identical icon-cards, the hero-metric
  template, tiny tracked uppercase eyebrows above every section.
- **Cheap purchased template**: clip-art icons, stock-everything, obviously-a-theme.
- **Overdesigned**: animation for its own sake, style that fights legibility.
- **Corporate-cold**: faceless enterprise navy-and-gray with no warmth or point of view.

The pull to resolve: studio-agency boldness *without* tipping into any of the four
above. Every confident move must stay instantly legible to a café owner on a phone.

## Evidence on Hand

Canonical working projects currently on the site (see `src/content/projects/` and
`master.md`): Herminia's Food and Justdiz Preproductions as art-directed commercial
demos; Order Management System + CRM Dashboard, Fundsicles, and Pearl Anniversary as
public-demo personal commissions; The Big Thirty as a privacy-safe full-stack build
backed by an isolated Netlify Blobs store; and the Bubu Workout microsite. Visible
craft of the portfolio itself is also evidence. Do not fabricate testimonials,
pricing, or live-client claims beyond what these sources support.

## Product Principles

1. **Practice what you preach.** He sells fast, polished, accessible sites, so the
   portfolio must be the best one in his portfolio — performance, a11y, and polish
   are the pitch, not afterthoughts.
2. **Proof over claims.** The projects above and visible craft do the arguing. Each
   project is designed around its own audience, not a shared template.
3. **One obvious next action.** The whole site funnels to a single verb — email or
   call. No forms, no funnels, no dead ends; the contact path is never more than a
   glance away.
4. **Confident, never loud.** Bold type, decisive color, and purposeful motion —
   but readability wins every tie. Sharp, not noisy.
5. **Warm the navy.** Navy earns trust; amber, type, and plain human copy supply
   the personality. Never faceless-corporate, never cheap-template.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- **WCAG 2.1 AA** baseline. Contrast is verified on every text/background pair,
  including the amber and steel accents, in both light and dark themes.
- Full keyboard operability with visible `:focus-visible` states, a skip link, and
  semantic landmarks.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is honored for every animation (reveal, hover, theme).
- Mobile-first and fast on low-end devices over metered connections — the primary
  audience is on phones.
